## Project Overview
This repository contains the completed assignment provided by **Zenstreet AI**. The project involves [briefly describe the task, e.g., creating a React-based UI component that displays availability information with icons and interactive features]. The solution focuses on clean design, responsive layout, and efficient use of Material-UI components.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic UI**: Utilized Material-UI and React to build visually appealing and functional components.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured compatibility across different screen sizes and devices.

- **Custom Styling**: Applied custom `sx` styling for consistent appearance.
- **Design**: Tried to make as similar as given by you in figma file


---

## Technologies Used
- **Next**: Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Aceternity UI**: For prebuilt React components and styling.
- **Icons**: Used `@mui/icons-material` and `react-icons` for high-quality icons.
